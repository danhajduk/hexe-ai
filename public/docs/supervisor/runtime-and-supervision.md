# Runtime and Supervision

## Current Responsibilities

Status: Implemented

- Core owns desired-state intent and calls into Supervisor for host-local standalone runtime actions where implemented.
- Supervisor reports host resources and process state through `/api/supervisor/health`, `/api/supervisor/resources`, and `/api/supervisor/runtime`.
- Supervisor produces admission context through `/api/supervisor/admission`.
- Supervisor lists standalone addon runtime state and performs start/stop/restart actions through `/api/supervisor/nodes` and the corresponding node action routes.
- Standalone addon realization is compose-based today through `compose_up` and `compose_down` in `backend/app/supervisor/service.py`.

## Restart Semantics Boundary

Status: Implemented

- Backend process supervision is owned by systemd user service template (`systemd/user/synthia-backend.service.in`) with:
  - `Restart=always`
  - `RestartSec=2`
- Embedded MQTT docker runtime restart policy is owned by runtime boundary config (`backend/app/system/mqtt/runtime_boundary.py`) via:
  - `SYNTHIA_MQTT_DOCKER_RESTART_POLICY` (default `no`)
- This means backend process auto-restart and MQTT container auto-restart are separate controls.
- Operators should not assume backend restart policy implies docker container restart policy.

## Store and Runtime Interaction

Status: Implemented

- Store lifecycle writes desired/runtime-linked state for addon deployment outcomes.
- Runtime status and diagnostics APIs expose deployment/runtime realization status.

## Explicit Non-Goals

Status: Implemented

Supervisor does not currently implement:

- OS administration
- package management
- general service supervision outside Hexe-managed runtimes
- firewall or network policy control
- non-Hexe orchestration

## Future Expansion Path

Status: Not developed

Future growth can extend this boundary toward:

- broader host-local workload supervision
- managed worker execution ownership
- richer reconciliation loops
- runtime backends beyond compose
